  <p class="muted">
    For context, that day was the first class with teacher Eduardo. But at that time, I was in a trip to Lages/SC. I had a good time, ate a lot, rode a horse (very cool, by the way), and spent time with my family.

  <p class="muted">Besides that, the teacher and my classmates later told me the content of the lesson; They introduce themselves and talked about Lingua Franca.</p>
