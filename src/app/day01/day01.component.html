    <h1>Class 1 (26/05)</h1>
    <h2>Lingua Franca</h2>
    <p>For context, that day was the first class with teacher Eduardo. But at that time, I was in a trip to Lages/SC. I had a good time, ate a lot, rode a horse (very cool, by the way), and spent time with my family.</p>
    <p>Besides that, the teacher and my classmates later told me the content of the lesson; They introduce themselves and talked about Lingua Franca.</p>
    <div id="lingua-franca">
            <p>Lingua Franca is a term used to describe a language that is adopted as a common means of communication between people who speak different native languages. Historically, the original "Lingua Franca" was a mix of Italian, French, Spanish, Greek, and Arabic used for.
